# PathwayPilot
PathwayPilot is a taxonomy assignment and pathway visualisation tool for metaproteomics data. It combines Unipept [[1]](#1) and KEGG [[2]](#2) to provide pathway visualisations showing which pathways are represented in which species. It works both with peptide and protein input. 

## Usage
PathwayPilot is available as a webapplication via [pathwaypilot.ugent.be](https://pathwaypilot.ugent.be).
